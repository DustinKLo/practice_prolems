1. create instance
	- configure the instance to be able to launch server (apache, django, working website)
	- create AMI from the server (right click -> image -> create image)
2. create launch configuration
	- choose existing AMI (your instance you just created)
3. create auto scaling with launch configuration
	- always have default VPC (if not, contact AWS and they'll create one for you)
	- "use scaling policy to adjust capacity of group" if you have more info about your needs and load
		-  "keep this group at initial size" for demo
	- add notification - emails if server load is too high
	- this will create a new ec2 instance (with auto-scaling security group)

4. load balancer
	- users will now hit your "website" (which is your auto-scaling group) and the load balancer will equally redirect the traffic
	- application load balancer
		- allows load balancer to go to a different set of servers (auto-scaling group)
			- all traffic goes through the address of the load balancer
			- ie. image and blog part of website
	- classic load balancer
		- equally distribute traffic to the servers, regardless of which application theyre using
	- create new load balancer security group (HTTP port 80)
	- target group needs to point to auto-scaling group
		- auto-scaling group -> edit -> target group -> <add target group created earlier>
	- on load balancer dashboard -> highlight load balancer
		- on bottom, click "view/edit rules"
		- allows website to point specific route path to target group for auto-scaling
